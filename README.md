# Crystals Game

## Overview
A basic guessing game where the app chooses a random number between 15 and 120. The user is given 4 crystals, each with a different hidden value from 1 to 12.

The user clicks on the crystals and attempts to match the User Score with the Random Number.

If the user score matches the Random Number, the user wins.

If the user score exceeds the Random Number the User loses.

When the game resets, a new random number is chosen and then value of each crystal changes.
